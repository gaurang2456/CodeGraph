# CodeGraph

### AI-Powered Repository Intelligence & Developer Workflow

CodeGraph is an AI-powered developer tool that helps developers **understand, explore, modify, validate, and ship codebases**.

Instead of treating a repository as a collection of files, CodeGraph builds an understanding of the codebase using:

- Semantic search
- Vector embeddings
- RAG
- AST-based code analysis
- Code relationships
- Architecture visualization
- AI-powered feature planning
- AI-generated code changes
- Diff-based review
- Automated validation
- GitHub integration

The goal is simple:

> **Understand the codebase before changing it, review changes before applying them, and never silently destroy existing work.**

## 🚀 What CodeGraph Does

CodeGraph provides an end-to-end workflow for working with unfamiliar or complex repositories.

```text
Repository
    ↓
Repository Analysis
    ↓
Semantic Search + Code Graph
    ↓
Architecture Understanding
    ↓
AI Feature Planning
    ↓
AI Code Generation
    ↓
Diff Review
    ↓
Validation
    ↓
Human Approval
    ↓
GitHub Feature Branch
    ↓
Commit & Push
    ↓
Pull Request
```

This allows developers to move from **understanding a repository** to **safely implementing a feature** without losing control of the changes.

---

# ✨ Features

## 📦 Repository Ingestion

CodeGraph can ingest repositories from:

- Uploaded repository files
- GitHub repository URLs
- Connected GitHub accounts

During ingestion, the repository is analyzed and its contents are stored for further processing.

---

## 🔎 Semantic Code Search

CodeGraph converts repository content into semantic chunks and generates vector embeddings.

This enables meaning-based search instead of relying only on exact keyword matching.

For example, instead of searching for:

```text
authentication
```

CodeGraph can retrieve code related to:

- Login
- Sessions
- OAuth
- JWT handling
- User authentication middleware

even when the exact search term does not appear in the source code.

---

## 🧠 Repository-Aware AI Chat

CodeGraph provides an AI chat interface that uses repository context to answer questions about the codebase.

The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant code before generating a response.

Responses can include citations pointing back to relevant repository files.

Example questions:

```text
How does authentication work in this project?

Where is the database connection initialized?

Which files are responsible for user registration?

How does the application handle API errors?

What would I need to change to add email verification?
```

---

# 🕸️ AST-Based Code Graph

CodeGraph uses AST analysis to understand the structure of the source code.

The system extracts symbols such as:

- Classes
- Functions
- Interfaces
- Methods
- Variables
- Imports

It also builds relationships between symbols.

Supported relationship types include:

```text
IMPORTS
EXTENDS
IMPLEMENTS
USES
INJECTS
CALLS
```

This creates a graph representation of how different parts of the repository interact.

---

# 🏗️ Architecture Visualization

The extracted code relationships are used to generate an interactive architecture view.

Instead of manually searching through hundreds of files, developers can visually explore relationships between different parts of the codebase.

The architecture graph can help answer questions such as:

```text
Which components depend on this class?

Where is this service used?

Which files import this module?

What extends this base class?

What parts of the system are connected to this component?
```

---

# 📁 File Explorer

CodeGraph includes a repository file explorer for navigating analyzed repositories.

Developers can:

- Browse repository files
- Navigate directories
- Open source files
- Inspect file contents
- Move between architecture nodes and their corresponding files

This connects the abstract architecture graph back to the actual source code.

---

# 🔐 Authentication

CodeGraph supports authentication through Supabase Auth.

Supported authentication methods include:

- Email / Password
- Google OAuth
- GitHub OAuth

GitHub authentication also enables authenticated GitHub operations after the user connects their account.

Sensitive GitHub provider tokens remain server-side and are not exposed to the frontend.

---

# 📝 AI Feature Planning

CodeGraph can turn a natural-language feature request into an implementation plan.

For example:

```text
Add email verification to the registration flow.
```

The AI analyzes the repository and produces a structured feature plan identifying the files and areas that need to change.

The planning stage is designed to happen **before code generation**.

---

# 🤖 AI Code Generation

After approving a feature plan, CodeGraph can generate the required code changes.

Instead of immediately modifying the repository, the generated changes are represented as a versioned changeset.

This provides a controlled workflow:

```text
Feature Request
      ↓
AI Analysis
      ↓
Feature Plan
      ↓
Human Approval
      ↓
Code Generation
      ↓
Versioned Changeset
```

---

# 🔀 Versioned Changesets

Generated changes are stored as immutable/versioned changesets.

This makes it possible to:

- Review generated changes
- Compare different versions
- Approve changes
- Reject changes
- Regenerate changes
- Track the state of proposed modifications

The original repository is not immediately overwritten.

---

# 📊 Diff Viewer

CodeGraph provides a Git-style diff viewer for generated changes.

Developers can inspect:

- Added files
- Modified files
- Deleted files
- Added lines
- Removed lines
- Original content
- Proposed content

The diff can be viewed in a unified or side-by-side format.

The workflow is intentionally:

```text
Generate
   ↓
Review Diff
   ↓
Validate
   ↓
Approve
```

rather than blindly applying AI-generated code.

---

# 🧪 Automated Code Validation

Before changes are shipped, CodeGraph can validate the proposed changes inside a temporary workspace.

Validation can detect and use repository tooling where applicable.

For example:

```text
TypeScript
Build
Tests
```

Validation is repository-aware.

If a particular validation method is not applicable, it is skipped instead of being incorrectly reported as a failure.

For example, a repository without a `tsconfig.json` should not be treated as a TypeScript validation failure.

Validation states distinguish between:

```text
PASSED
FAILED
SKIPPED
ERROR
```

This prevents missing tooling from being confused with broken code.

---

# 🐙 GitHub Integration

CodeGraph integrates with GitHub to provide a controlled path from generated code to an actual repository change.

The GitHub workflow is designed around feature branches rather than directly modifying the default branch.

```text
Approved Changeset
       ↓
GitHub Feature Branch
       ↓
Commit
       ↓
Push
       ↓
Pull Request
```

---

# 🌿 Safe Feature Branches

CodeGraph never directly modifies the repository's default branch during the feature workflow.

Feature branches are created using a deterministic naming pattern:

```text
codegraph/feature-plan-{planId}-v{version}
```

The system dynamically detects the repository's default branch before creating the feature branch.

---

# 🛡️ Repository Drift Protection

One of the most important safety mechanisms in CodeGraph is repository drift detection.

Suppose CodeGraph generated a change based on:

```text
Version A
```

but the repository has since changed to:

```text
Version B
```

Applying the old changes blindly could overwrite newer developer work.

CodeGraph therefore checks whether the repository still matches the state against which the changeset was generated.

If the repository has drifted:

```text
STOP
```

rather than silently overwriting newer code.

This is particularly important for AI-generated code changes.

---

# 💾 Git Commit & Push

Approved changes can be committed to the generated GitHub feature branch.

The workflow is designed to:

- Avoid modifying the default branch
- Create one logical commit per changeset
- Prevent duplicate commits
- Protect against branch SHA conflicts
- Re-check repository state
- Persist GitHub commit metadata

---

# 🔗 Pull Request Creation

After changes are committed and pushed, CodeGraph can create a GitHub Pull Request.

The Pull Request workflow includes:

- Correct feature branch
- Correct base branch
- Deterministic title
- Generated description
- Validation summary
- Changeset information

CodeGraph does **not automatically merge the Pull Request**.

The final merge decision remains with the developer.

# 🔄 Complete Developer Workflow

## 1. Add a Repository

A developer uploads a repository or provides a GitHub repository.

```text
Repository
    ↓
Ingestion
    ↓
File Storage
```

---

## 2. Analyze the Repository

CodeGraph processes the repository and creates:

```text
Source Files
     ↓
Semantic Chunks
     ↓
Embeddings

Source Files
     ↓
AST Analysis
     ↓
Symbols
     ↓
Relationships
```

---

## 3. Understand the Architecture

The generated symbols and relationships are used to build an architecture graph.

Developers can navigate from graph nodes back to their source files.

---

## 4. Ask Questions

The developer can use repository-aware AI chat.

```text
Question
   ↓
Semantic Retrieval
   ↓
Relevant Repository Context
   ↓
AI Response
   ↓
File Citations
```

---

## 5. Request a Feature

The developer describes a desired change.

```text
"Add password reset functionality."
```

CodeGraph analyzes the repository and generates a feature plan.

---

## 6. Review the Plan

The developer reviews the proposed implementation before code generation.

---

## 7. Generate Code

After approval, CodeGraph generates a versioned changeset.

```text
Feature Plan
     ↓
AI Code Generation
     ↓
Changeset
```

---

## 8. Review the Diff

The developer inspects the generated changes using the diff viewer.

---

## 9. Validate

CodeGraph creates a temporary workspace and validates the proposed changes using applicable repository tooling.

```text
Changeset
    ↓
Temporary Workspace
    ↓
Apply Changes
    ↓
Validation
```

---

## 10. Approve

Only after the developer reviews and approves the changes can they proceed to the GitHub workflow.

---

## 11. Create Feature Branch

CodeGraph creates a dedicated feature branch.

```text
main
 │
 └── codegraph/feature-plan-...
```

The default branch is not directly modified.

---

## 12. Commit & Push

The approved changes are committed and pushed to the feature branch.

---

## 13. Create Pull Request

CodeGraph creates a Pull Request targeting the repository's default branch.

The developer retains control over the final merge.

---

# 🔒 Security Principles

CodeGraph follows several principles when handling repositories and GitHub operations.

### No Direct Default-Branch Modification

Generated changes are pushed to feature branches rather than directly modifying the default branch.

### Human Approval

AI-generated code is reviewed before being shipped.

### Repository Drift Detection

Changes are not blindly applied when the repository has changed since the changeset was generated.

### Server-Side GitHub Credentials

GitHub provider tokens are kept server-side and are not exposed to the client.

### Temporary Validation Environments

Proposed changes are validated in temporary workspaces rather than directly modifying the original repository.

### Immutable Changesets

Generated changes are represented as versioned changesets, allowing developers to review different generated versions.

---

# 🎯 Design Philosophy

CodeGraph is built around three principles.

## 1. Understand Before Modifying

The system should understand the repository before proposing changes.

```text
Repository
    ↓
AST + Semantic Analysis
    ↓
Code Graph
    ↓
Repository Context
    ↓
AI Planning
```

The AI should not treat a repository as a pile of unrelated files.

---

## 2. Review Before Applying

AI-generated code should not immediately modify the user's repository.

```text
Generate
    ↓
Diff
    ↓
Validate
    ↓
Human Approval
    ↓
Apply
```

The developer remains in control of the final change.

---

## 3. Never Destroy Existing Work

Before applying changes, CodeGraph verifies that the repository still matches the state against which the changeset was generated.

If it does not:

```text
STOP
```

rather than silently overwriting newer code.

---

# 🚧 Future Improvements

Potential future improvements include:

- AI-powered code review
- More advanced repository dependency analysis
- Improved architecture detection
- Better language support
- More validation strategies
- Improved navigation performance
- Smarter client-side data caching
- Background repository analysis
- More GitHub workflow automation
- Improved large-repository support
- Advanced code impact analysis

---

A typical development workflow is:

```text
Fork
  ↓
Create Feature Branch
  ↓
